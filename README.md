# Billing Management System using Python's Tkinter

### Description:
This is a simple **Billing Management System** built with Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can add items, delete items, and view an updated bill, which includes item details, quantity, price, and the total bill amount.

---

### Features:
1. **Add Item to Bill**:
   - Users can input an item's name, quantity, and price.
   - The system calculates the total price for each item (`quantity Ã— price`).
   - The item is added to the bill, and the display updates dynamically.

2. **Delete Item from Bill**:
   - Users can enter the name of an item to remove it from the bill.
   - If the item exists, it is deleted, and the bill is updated.
   - If the item doesn't exist, an error message is shown.

3. **Bill Display**:
   - Displays all added items in a structured format with their quantity, price, and total cost.
   - Automatically calculates and shows the total bill amount at the bottom.

### Code Explanation:
1. **Main Window Initialization**:
   - A `Tkinter` window (`root`) is created with a title and specific dimensions.
   
2. **Variable Management**:
   - Uses `tk.StringVar`, `tk.IntVar`, and `tk.DoubleVar` to manage user input dynamically for item details and deletion.

3. **Functions**:
   - `add_item()`: Adds an item to the bill after validating user input and updates the bill display.
   - `delete_item()`: Removes an item from the bill based on the item's name.
   - `update_bill_display()`: Updates the GUI to reflect the latest bill, including formatting and total amount calculation.
   - `clear_entries()`: Resets input fields for adding a new item.

4. **Layout**:
   - Input fields for adding an item (name, quantity, price) and deleting an item by name.
   - Buttons to add or delete items.
   - A `Text` widget to display the bill dynamically.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file (e.g., `billing_system.py`).
3. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   python billing_system.py
   ```
4. Interact with the GUI to manage a simple billing operation.

### Future Enhancements:
- Add features like saving the bill as a file (e.g., `.txt` or `.pdf`).
- Include more validations (e.g., preventing duplicate item names).
- Add an option to edit item details.
- Provide graphical representations (e.g., bar charts for category-wise totals).
